# Visual Debugger - Project Description

## What Are We Building?

Visual Debugger is a comprehensive Python library designed for debugging and analyzing image and video processing workflows. It provides a visual annotation and debugging toolkit that allows developers to add visual markers, annotations, and diagnostic information directly onto images during the processing pipeline.

The library serves as a visual inspection and debugging layer that can be integrated into any computer vision or image processing application, enabling developers to visualize intermediate processing steps, track algorithm behavior, and debug complex visual workflows.

## What Problem Are We Solving?

### Core Problems

1. **Debugging Opacity**: Image processing pipelines often operate as "black boxes" where intermediate steps and transformations are difficult to inspect and understand.

2. **Visual Verification Challenges**: Developers struggle to verify whether their algorithms are working correctly without visual feedback on what's happening at each processing stage.

3. **Complex Data Visualization**: When working with computer vision algorithms, developers need to visualize multiple types of data simultaneously - detection boxes, keypoints, masks, orientations, motion vectors, and statistical information.

4. **Workflow Documentation**: There's a lack of tools that can automatically generate visual documentation of image processing workflows for review, debugging, or presentation purposes.

5. **Video Analysis Complexity**: Video processing adds temporal dimensions that require specialized visualization tools for motion analysis, frame-by-frame debugging, and temporal trend visualization.

## Project Scopes

### Current Scope
- **Image Annotation System**: Support for points, circles, rectangles, lines, labels, and masks
- **Orientation Visualization**: 3D orientation projection (pitch/yaw/roll) onto 2D image planes
- **Multi-Image Management**: Concatenation and side-by-side comparison of multiple processed images
- **Automatic Workflow Documentation**: Sequential naming and organization of debug outputs
- **Flexible Output Options**: Save to disk or return in-memory for further processing

### Proposed Enhancement Scope (From Enhancement Proposal)
- **Time-Series Visualization**: Graphs, charts, timelines, and sparklines for temporal data
- **Information Displays**: Info boxes, tables, and dashboard panels for metrics
- **Progress Indicators**: Progress bars, meters, gauges, and status indicators
- **Advanced Overlays**: Heatmaps, alpha overlays, gradients, and contour maps
- **Directional Indicators**: Arrows, vector fields, trajectories, and flow lines
- **Enhanced Positioning**: Relative positioning, anchoring, and z-order management
- **Animation Support**: Fade effects, blinking, and temporal visibility control
- **Annotation Groups**: Manage related annotations as logical groups

### Future Vision Scope
- **Real-time Debugging**: Live debugging capabilities for streaming video
- **Interactive Debugging**: Click-to-inspect and interactive annotation editing
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Visualization tools specifically for ML model debugging
- **Performance Profiling**: Visual performance metrics and bottleneck identification
- **Collaborative Features**: Sharing and collaborative debugging capabilities
